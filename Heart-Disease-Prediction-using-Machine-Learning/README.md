# ***Heart_Disease_Prediction***

*Effective data-driven systems can significantly enhance the research and prevention of heart diseases, ultimately leading to improved overall health for a larger population. Machine Learning plays a crucial role in accurately predicting heart diseases.*

•	The heart disease patient dataset was thoroughly analyzed and processed for the project. Subsequently, a model was trained and predictions were generated using a Machine Learning algorithm.

•	Utilizing Logistic Regression from Machine Learning algorithms in Python, I have successfully predicted the likelihood of heart disease in patients. This involved addressing a classification problem, where various parameters served as input features and the target variable was a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

#### *Result*: Project achieves an accuracy of approximately 0.83 using a Logistic Regression model.
